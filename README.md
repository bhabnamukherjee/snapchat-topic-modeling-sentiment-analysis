**Title:** Snapchat User Reviews — Topic Modeling & Sentiment Insights

**Overview** Analyzed 43,624 cleaned Snapchat user comments to identify key discussion themes and topic-level sentiment signals using a reproducible text-analytics workflow.

- Data cleaning + preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, custom stopwords)
- Sentiment analysis using VADER
- Topic modeling using LDA, model selection using coherence, log perplexity, and interpretability
- Visualization using LDAvis and MDS maps

**Key Findings (5 Topics Identified)**

- Camera Issues
- User Enjoyment
- Ad-Related Disruptions
